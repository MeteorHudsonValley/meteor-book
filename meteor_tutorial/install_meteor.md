# Install Meteor

1)
Install the latest version of Meteor using the following command. This should work on Mac and Linux. Windows users may need to install a VM that runs Linux till a native Windows distribution becomes available.

```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```
This should install Meteor packages and core dependencies as well (e.g., Mongo, Node) as required.


2)
Verify that your installation works by running 'meteor' as follows and verifying the version running. (Your local version may be different from mine)

```
meteor --version
Meteor 1.0.2.1
```
