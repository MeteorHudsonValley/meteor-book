The book contains materials collected in the context of running a series of Meteor Workshop events at [Meteor Hudson Valley](http://www.meetup.com/Meteor-Hudson-Valley). The goal is to support group or self-study efforts around Meteor development.

### Acknowledgment and Accreditation

I have made a conscious effort to hyperlink to every external or public resource used in these materials. Most such content involves  official tutorials or third-party articles that I found added value to a workshop.

The primary goal was to provide a structured walkthrough of these materials. Most of my original content is in the *Notes* section of each chapter, reflecting insights or issues that I wanted to highlight in context.

**This book is not meant for sale, only as a convenience for meetup members.**De
