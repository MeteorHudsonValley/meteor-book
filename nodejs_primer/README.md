# NodeJS Primer

### About node.js

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is a platform built on the [Chrome V8 JavaScript engine](https://code.google.com/p/v8/).

It allows developers to write *server side* components using the same JavaScript platform that is used by the client (on browsers).

It uses an *event-driven*, *non-blocking I/O* model that makes it ideal for developing *real-time* applications for distributed devices.

It has since been used to create or complement [numerous web application frameworks](http://webdesignmoo.com/2014/21-best-node-js-frameworks-2014/) to create an all-JavaScript full-stack environment for developers.

### node.js and io.js
Node has traditionally been maintained by one entity (Joyent) with significant contributions from the open source community.

In Nov 2014, a splinter group in favor of **more open governance** for Node forked it into a new distribution called [io.js](https://github.com/iojs/io.js).

The [move made headlines](http://readwrite.com/2014/12/10/node-js-io-js-developers-faq)and some key startups and software developers are [already favoring it](https://twitter.com/mranney/status/540013975568535553).

### NodeSchool.io Workshops

Numerous tutorials exist for node, but [NodeSchool.io](http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers) version is an officially recommended place to start for self or group study.

To work through these tutorials, you ***MUST have installed Node and the Node package manager (npm)*** before you begin.

You also need a good code editor (e.g., Sublime Text, WebStorm).

* Install Node ([instructions](http://nodejs.org/))
* NPM comes bundled in with Node. ([details](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm))

In addition, you may need to install other software or tools for some sections:
* Install Git (or GitHub)
